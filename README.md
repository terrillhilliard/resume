This portfolio web app was created using Next.js, a popular framework for building server-rendered React applications. By utilizing server-side rendering, this app is able to provide a seamless and efficient experience for users.

In addition, the app was built with TypeScript, a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing. This not only allows for type checking and improved code maintainability, but also enhances the overall reliability and scalability of the app.

Finally, the design of the app was implemented using Tailwind, a utility-first CSS framework. This allows for a more efficient and modular approach to styling, resulting in a clean and cohesive visual design throughout the app.
